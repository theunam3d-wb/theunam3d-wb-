# 👋 Greetings, Traveler — I'm W.B.

I'm an independent AI developer and conceptual designer, currently exploring the intersections between **human thought, code, and adaptive intelligence**.

I build projects that merge creative narrative with technical precision — such as **Verus**, a personality-driven AI assistant, and **Guess It**, a logic-based interactive game.

## 🧠 My Focus
- Artificial Intelligence and conversational design  
- Python development and automation  
- Cognitive systems and emergent behavior  
- Writing, theory, and human–AI symbiosis

## ⚙️ Current Projects
### [Verus — The AI Companion](https://github.com/theunam3d-wb/Verus-AI-Assistant)  
A minimalist yet evolving AI system built for natural, adaptive dialogue.

### [Guess It — Logic and Probability Game](https://github.com/theunam3d-wb/Guess-It-Game)  
An interactive number guessing challenge exploring probability and feedback systems.

## 🌱 Ongoing Goals
- Refine Verus toward conversational autonomy  
- Contribute to open AI ethics and practical applications  
- Continue merging storytelling with machine reasoning

*"Balance, understanding, and endurance — the core of both code and being."*
